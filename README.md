# Analyzing-alcohol-consumption
This project was completed as a part of the course Analyzing data with python. 

New York is a global city with over 846 spoken languages. A new wine and brewery establishment wants to analyze the drinking habits of the population by nationality to help determine their inventory. As a Data Scientist, you are asked to lead this project, and analyze the data of alcohol consumption around the world to better serve your companyâ€™s diverse customer base.

In this project I have analyzed and predicted alcohol consumption by country using attributes or features such as beer servings and wine servings.
